# Shift an Array

## Challenge
Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and the value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.  

## Approach & Efficiency
Like the challenge before, I knew I'd need a seperate function to find the array length. Then I would need to take that length to create a new Array and loop over the input array, adding values to the new Array and adding the new value when the middle index is reached.
